################ IDEAS 
################

+ charm system
    + 1+ use of shape power-up when a certain color (many of these)
    + modified powerups
        + longer attack, dash, etc. range (seperate )
    + keep keys when you die
    + view map
    + map is colored 
    + collect same shape multiple times for added benefits/multiple uses
    + don't anger enemies of same color
    + don't crumble platforms of same color (or certain color ever?)
    + gravity?
    + change color/shape/gravity at will
+ combine charms OR many charm slots OR upgrade charms

+ binding system
    + bind abilities to certain colors/shapes?

+ find power source in each color world and activate it to unlock color in hub
    + multiple power sources in each world, acting kind of like checkpoints
    + just portals at first, then change to shifters?
    + also unlock different shapes at start?
+ immune to enemies/obstacles when the same color
+ different shapes with different abilities
    ideas:
        + circle = basic
        + star = change world
        + blob = control enemies?
        + ghost = float (endgame?)
        + lightning bolt? = dash
        + traingle/diamond/arrowhead/? = attack
        + 6-sided star/fireball? = shoot 
        + ? = teleport
            + place portals and travel back to them at will
        + circle/egg = change gravity?
            + egg -> circle -> egg animation when gravity changes

        + many other shapes??
            + walljump/climb
            + double jump (extraneous with dash)

OLD
+ some kind of charm or item system for collectables or equipable abilities
    + change color at will
    + change shape at will
    + increased range (specific shape and/or color?)
    + extra life
+ colors affect how the abilities work?
    + different effects on dash/shooting (fire, lightning, ect.)
